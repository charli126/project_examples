## Project description

Ths project uses the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. The goal of the project is to  examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 with a series of plots. 

**Dataset**: Electric power consumption: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

**Description**: The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns, containing measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. The following is a description of the 9 variables: 

- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
